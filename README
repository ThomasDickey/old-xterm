			Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here


This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.  It was one of
the first "serious" programs ported, and still has a lot of historical baggage.
Ideally, there would be a general tty widget and then vt102 and tek4014 
subwidgets so that they could be used in other programs.  We are trying to 
clean things up as we go, but there is still a lot of work to do.

If you are porting this to a machine that has problems with overlapping
bcopy's, watch out!

Two lists of Control Sequences are provided.  The file ctlseq.ms is based on
the X10 document, with minor and far from sufficient edits.  The file
ctlseq2.txt is the result of someone walking through the code.  Ideally,
the two should be merged into one document.
