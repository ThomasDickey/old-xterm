This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.  It was one of
the "serious" first programs ported, and still has a lot of historical baggage.
We are trying as hard as possible to fix it, but we really need someone to go
off and start again.  It would be really nice if the emulator packages were
completely separate from each other as well as from the control structures
so that new emulators would be easy to plug in.

If you are porting this to a machine that has problems with overlapping
bcopy's, watch out!   You may have to write your own.  See the Imakefile
and Makefile for more information on how to do this.

The Xterm Control Sequences document still needs a lot of work and may not
be completely accurate.
